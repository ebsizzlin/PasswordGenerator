# PasswordGenerator

The purpose of this assignment is to create a random password generator in a browser with prompts.

# completed:

- variables listed
- all the prompted questions are asked
- alert for 0/4 choices
- if and else if statements
- for loop (maybe)
- function

# what's probably not working:

- after the alert for not picking a #, the alert for not picking an option comes up even though those haven't been offered yet
- not sure if what i've come up with from googling for loops really works since i don't get the concept in the first place
